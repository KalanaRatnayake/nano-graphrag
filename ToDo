## 1. Finalize C++/Python parity
- [ ] Review all major features and APIs for parity with Python nano-graphrag. Ensure strategies, storage, chunking, LLM, embedding, and graph logic match or are documented as intentionally different.

## 2. Expand graph/entity features
- [ ] Implement advanced graph/entity extraction, clustering, and community schema in C++ (see Python's NetworkXStorage, entity extraction, and community reports).

## 3. Improve error handling and state management
- [ ] Review error handling, return types, and state management for all storage and graph classes. Ensure robust handling and clear error messages.

## 4. Add batch and async-like operations
- [ ] Implement batch upsert/query and async-like callback support for storage and graph classes, matching Python's pipeline flexibility.

## 5. Document all strategies and extension points
- [ ] Ensure all strategies (embedding, LLM, tokenizer, chunking, storage) are documented and easy to extend. Update docs and README with extension instructions.

## 6. Add more tests and CI coverage
- [ ] Expand C++ test coverage for all modes (naive, local, global), edge cases, and error paths. Ensure CI runs all tests and demo/benchmark.

## 7. Review and update prompt templates
- [ ] Port and review all prompt templates from Python to C++ (Prompts.hpp). Ensure coverage for entity extraction, community report, local/global RAG, and fallback.

## 8. Review REST client and HTTP features
- [ ] Ensure RestClient in C++ is robust, supports all needed features, and is documented. Add missing features if needed.
